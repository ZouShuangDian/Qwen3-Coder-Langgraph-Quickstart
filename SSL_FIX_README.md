# SSL Certificate Fix Summary

The SSL certificate verification errors were occurring because the application was unable to verify SSL certificates when making HTTPS requests to external services (likely the Google Gemini API). Here's what was done to fix the issue:

## Changes Made

1. **Created SSL Configuration File**
   - Created `backend/src/agent/ssl_config.py` with proper SSL context configuration
   - Added certificate verification using certifi's certificate bundle
   - Added environment variable support for disabling SSL verification in development

2. **Updated Main Application**
   - Modified `backend/src/agent/app.py` to import and initialize SSL configuration
   - Added SSL environment configuration at application startup

3. **Updated Graph Logic**
   - Modified `backend/src/agent/graph.py` to use SSL context for Google API client
   - Updated all ChatGoogleGenerativeAI instances with proper transport settings
   - Added connection close headers to prevent connection pooling issues

4. **Updated Dependencies**
   - Added `certifi` and `urllib3` to `backend/pyproject.toml`

## How to Test the Fix

1. Reinstall the backend package:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install .
   ```

2. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   make dev
   ```

Or alternatively:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   langgraph dev
   ```

The SSL certificate errors should no longer appear in the logs.
